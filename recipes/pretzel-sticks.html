            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl. 
                    let it rest for 10 minutes. The yeast should be completely
                    dissolved and foaming. Mix in the oil.
                </li>
                <li>In a separate large bowl, whisk in together the flour and salt.
                    Add the liquids and begin mixing until a dough is formed. 
                    Let ir rest for 5 min and then knead it until it begins to pull away
                    from the sides of the bolw. Let it rest 5 more minutes.
                </li>
                <li>After the dough has rested, if it keeps sticking to the sides of the bowl.
                    flour the surface where you will work on, if not, just turn int on a clean
                    surface. Continue kneading it until the dough is smooth and elastic.
                    Transfer the dough to a grased bowl and cover it with greased plastic wrap 
                    and let it rise for 45 minutes or until it doubles in size.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 250°C. Line your baking sheets with baking wax paper. 
                    Turn the dough on a clean surface and divide it into 24 equal pieces. Roll
                    each piece into a ball, cover them with a damp towel and let them rest for 15 minutes.
                    Then roll them into 20 cm. sticks.
                </li>
                <li>Using rubber or nitrile gloves, mix the water and lye into a metal or glass bowl 
                    to make the lye bath. Be careful not to make contact with eyes or skin.
                </li>
                <li>When the lye bath is ready, soak 4 to 6 pretzel sticks for about 20 seconds.
                    Then tranfer them with gloved hands into the baking sheet, leaving 2 cm between
                    them.
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle the pretzels with flaky sea salt and bake one sheet at a time for about 
                    10 to 15 minutes or until deep brown</li>
